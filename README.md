## Description
This full-stack web application enables users to upload images of diseased plants to diagnose their illnesses. When logged in, it includes a dashboard with analytics
and submission history to provide actionable insights. We used PyTorch to build a Machine Learning classification model on the backend. Was built with the intent to further innovation in the realm of agricultural sustainability. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone repo into your desired location
2. run ```npm install ```
3. run ```cd frontend ```
4. run ```npm run dev```
5. Look at localhost:3000 to see the frontend deployment
6. Open a new terminal and navigate to backend
7. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
8. python3 main.py

The backend should be up and running

## To Do
1. Improve model + expand to other plant types
2. Incorporate DB storage + retrieval of images
3. Live cam of model
4. Responsive UI for mobile + browser types
5. Fix HTTPS proxy security with Vercel - maybe nginx
6. Admin analytics
